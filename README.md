# IdeaLog

The IdeaLog is a place for you to write down your ideas before they dissapear forever. It's simple and easy to use. You'll arrive on the home page and proceed to log in using just a name, if you'd like, and then upload a thought and finally read all the ideas that have been posted.

# Log In

Currently the purpose of "Logging In" is to give each blurb an author. Attaching your name to the bottom, otherwise leaving an "Anonymous" tag.

# Upload Form

The Upload Form has two form inputs where you can put a title and the thought that you have. It also asks for you to categorize the thought, offering several options and defaulting to a Misc option. 

# Display Page 

The display page displays all the thoughts that have been uploaded so far. Offering a drop down to filter out any thoughts based on whatever category they have. There is also the option to like, or delete any posts. 

# Sign Out

Finally the Sign Out page is very simple. It will only appear if you have logged in and theres a big button labelled "Sign Out" where you can... sign out.
